# small_os
project Description : 
This is an implementation of a small scheduler module based on the event driven architecture that selects the tasks to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run.
According to test the module, I have built three Tasks each one has its own parameters (periodicity and priority) as I figured out in the attached snapshot, code and simulation file as well.
